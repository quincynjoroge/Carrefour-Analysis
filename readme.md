# Carrefour supermarket analysis
## Overview
## CONTEXT
Carrefour is a retail-focused global corporation based in France. It has operations in a number of countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Brazil, and, closer to home, Kenya.

As a data analyst at Carrefour Kenya, I'm now working on a project to tell the marketing department about the most effective marketing methods for generating the greatest sales (total price including tax).

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

The project is separated into four sections, each of which examines a recent marketing dataset using a variety of unsupervised learning approaches before making suggestions based on your findings.

Part 1: Reducing Dimensionality

PCA is used to reduce the dataset to a low-dimensional dataset in this section of the research.

Part 2: Choosing Features

This part calls on you to apply unsupervised learning methods to perform feature selection.

Association Rules (Part 3)

This section will require you to develop association rules in order to identify relationships between variables in the dataset.

Part 4: Detecting Anomalies

We will check if there are any.

## Requirements
- Rstudio,Rmarkdown
- R and it's libraries
